# Migrate from Azure to Google Cloud: Get started

Google Cloud provides tools, products, guidance, and professional services to
help you migrate workloads, data, and processes from Azure to Google Cloud. This
document introduces a discussion about how to design, implement, and validate a
plan to migrate from Azure to Google Cloud.

The discussion is intended for cloud administrators who want details about how
to plan and implement a migration process. It's also intended for
decision-makers who are evaluating the opportunity to migrate and who want to
explore what migration looks like.

Google Cloud offers robust capabilities and support for running Microsoft
stack-based workloads, with potential cost savings, depending on your specific
needs. For example, Cloud Run provides a serverless environment that scales
automatically based on demand for your .NET workloads, and Cloud SQL for SQL
Server offers a fully managed, SQL Server-compatible database experience.

Migrating your workloads, data, and processes from Azure to Google Cloud can be
a challenging task and can take days, weeks, or months to complete, depending on
the scope and size of the migration.

Azure and Google Cloud products that target similar use cases might seem similar
in the way you provision, configure, and use the resources that they provide.
However, despite similarities, these resources might differ significantly in the
way they work and in their requirements. We therefore recommend that you assess
the ways in which similar Azure and Google Cloud resources work before you plan
your migration.

This series provides guidance about the following migration journeys:

- **From Azure compute services to Google Cloud**:
    - [Migrate from Azure Virtual Machines to Compute Engine](./migrate-from-azure-vms-to-compute-engine.md)

- **From Azure data storage services to Google Cloud**:
    - [Migrate from Azure Blob Storage to Cloud Storage](./migrate-from-azure-blob-storage-to-cloud-storage.md)
- **From Azure database services to Google Cloud**
