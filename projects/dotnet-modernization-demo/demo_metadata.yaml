title: Gemini-powered .NET modernization
thumbnail_summary: Modernize a .NET Framework application to a Linux-ready .NET application using Gemini CLI, Migration Center App Modernization Assessment, and deploy to Google Cloud with Cloud Run and Cloud SQL.

purpose: |
  This demo guides you through modernizing a .NET Framework application to a Linux-ready .NET application and deploying it on Google Cloud. It leverages the Gemini CLI for application modernization and Migration Center's App Modernization Assessment for initial analysis.

  Key learning objectives:
  * Prepare the development environment for .NET modernization.
  * Generate a modernization assessment report using the `codmod` CLI.
  * Modernize a .NET application using the Gemini CLI.
  * Generate deployment descriptors for Google Cloud.
  * Deploy the modernized application to Google Cloud using Cloud Run and Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.

business_value: |
  Modernizing .NET applications to cloud-native architectures on Google Cloud offers substantial business advantages, driving agility, efficiency, and innovation.

  Key benefits include:
  * **Accelerated Innovation:** Migrate from legacy .NET Framework to modern .NET, enabling faster development cycles and adoption of new features.
  * **Cost Optimization:** Reduce infrastructure costs by moving to Linux-based containers and serverless platforms like Cloud Run, paying only for resources consumed.
  * **Increased Agility and Scalability:** Deploy applications on Cloud Run for automatic scaling, high availability, and rapid deployment capabilities.
  * **Reduced Operational Burden:** Leverage managed services like Cloud Run and Cloud SQL, minimizing operational overhead for infrastructure management.
  * **Data-Driven Modernization:** Utilize tools like the Migration Center App Modernization Assessment for informed decisions and streamlined modernization paths.

technical_value: |
  * **Automated Modernization:** Demonstrates the use of Gemini CLI to automatically refactor and modernize .NET Framework code to modern .NET standards.
  * **Migration Assessment:** Utilizes the `codmod` CLI (Migration Center App Modernization Assessment) to generate detailed reports for planning the modernization effort.
  * **Containerization:** Leverages Docker for packaging the modernized application, enabling portability and deployment across various environments.
  * **Serverless Deployment:** Deploys the containerized application to Cloud Run, a fully managed, serverless platform for containerized workloads.
  * **Managed Database:** Integrates with Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL to provide a fully managed relational database backend.
  * **CI/CD Integration:** Showcases how Google Cloud Build can be used to build and push container images to Artifact Registry for a streamlined deployment pipeline.
