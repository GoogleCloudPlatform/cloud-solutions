Based on the last 7 days of data, here are the key trends:

‚Ä¢ Peak hours (2-4 PM): 280ms average
‚Ä¢ Off-peak hours: 120ms average
‚Ä¢ 95th percentile: ${metrics?.responseTime || 250}ms

**Revenue Correlation:**
‚Ä¢ Strong negative correlation (-0.78) between response time and conversion
‚Ä¢ Every 100ms increase = ~3.2% revenue decrease
‚Ä¢ Optimal performance window: <200ms response time

**Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Implement auto-scaling during peak hours

**Impact Assessment:**
‚Ä¢ Payment timeouts correlate with high response times
‚Ä¢ Revenue impact: ~$${Math.round((metrics?.responseTime || 250) * 0.5)}/hour during spikes

**Immediate Actions:**
‚Ä¢ Check payment gateway connection pool
‚Ä¢ Implement payment retry logic
