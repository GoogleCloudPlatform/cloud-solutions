description = "Generate sample `aws lambda get-function-configuration` command output"

prompt = '''
Generate sample JSON output as if I was running the
"aws lambda get-policy --output json" and
"aws lambda list-event-source-mappings --output json" commands against an
existing AWS account.

Simulate running the command for each function listed in {{args}}.

When you generate the sample output for each function, take into account the
data in aws-lambda-get-function-[function-name].json and
aws-lambda-get-function-configuration-[function-name].json files in the same
directory as the function list file, if available.

Save the generated output files in the same directory as the input file. For
each function, create two files named aws-lambda-get-policy-[function-name].json
and aws-lambda-list-event-source-mappings-[function-name].json, and save the
generated output for that function there.

Make sure that each sample file:

- Respects the response syntax outlined in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_GetPolicy.html and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_ListEventSourceMappings.html respectively
- Is valid JSON
- All double quotes in the values should be escaped
- All new lines in JSON keys or values should be converted to \n
