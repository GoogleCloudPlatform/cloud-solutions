# Gemini Powered Migrations To Google Cloud

This project provides a set of Gemini CLI custom commands to accelerate
assessments and migration of workloads and data from Amazon Web Services (AWS)
and Azure to Google Cloud. The Gemini CLI custom commands use Gemini to analyze
data, identifying suitable resources for migration, and augmenting traditional
assessments with AI.

## Prerequisites

To effectively utilize these instructions, ensure the following are set up:

- **Gemini CLI:** Installed and configured. For installation instructions, visit
  [geminicli.com](https://geminicli.com/docs/get-started/deployment/).
- **Source Cloud Provider Inventory Details:** Access to inventory and
  assessment reports (e.g., bucket/container policies, locations, object lists)
  from your source cloud provider (AWS, Azure, etc.) for analysis. Sample inputs
  are available in the `test-data/` folder.

## Gemini CLI custom commands

The following custom commands are configured in this project under
`.gemini/commands` folder.

### Evaluate inventories

The custom commands in this section are aimed at helping you accelerate the
evaluation.

- **/aws-lambda-to-cloud-run-poc-selection:** This command assists in reviewing
  AWS Lambda inventories to identify suitable functions for migration to Cloud
  Run. Example:

    ```sh
    /aws-lambda-to-cloud-run-poc-selection Review files in test-data/aws-lambda-assessment-results for migration to Cloud Run.
    ```

- **/aws-s3-bucket-poc-selection:** This command assists in reviewing Amazon S3
  buckets inventories to identify suitable buckets for migration to Google Cloud
  Storage. Example:

    ```sh
    /aws-s3-bucket-poc-selection review files in test-data/aws-s3-assessment-results for migration to US EAST region.
    ```

- **/azure-blob-storage-poc-selection:** This command helps analyze Azure Blob
  Storage inventories to suggest containers that are good candidates for
  migration to Google Cloud Storage.

    ```sh
    /azure-blob-storage-poc-selection review files in test-data/azure-blob-storage-assessment-results for migration to US EAST region.
    ```

## Setup & Usage Instructions

1.  Install Gemini CLI. For installation instructions, visit
    [geminicli.com](https://geminicli.com/docs/get-started/deployment/).

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-solutions.git
    ```

1.  Configure the Gemini CLI custom commands in the
    `cloud-solutions/projects/gemini-powered-migrations-to-google-cloud`
    directory so that they are available as global user commands or project
    commands.

1.  Change the working directory to the directory where you stored the files you
    want to assess with Gemini CLI, such as inventory files from other cloud
    providers.

1.  Start Gemini CLI:

    ```sh
    gemini
    ```

1.  Run the Gemini CLI authentication command, and follow instructions:

    ```sh
    /auth
    ```

1.  Run one of the [provided custom commands](#gemini-cli-custom-commands).

1.  Review generated report with recommendations.

## Test Data

The `test-data/` directory contains sample inventories from Amazon S3 and Azure
Blob Storage. These files are structured to mimic real-world cloud provider
outputs and are used by the custom Gemini CLI commands to demonstrate the
migration selection process without requiring actual cloud environments. This
data includes:

- **`aws-lambda-assessment-results/`**: Contains mock data for AWS Lambda
  functions.
- **`aws-s3-assessment-results/`**: Contains mock data for S3 bucket locations,
  policies, and bucket lists.
- **`azure-blob-storage-assessment-results/`**: Contains mock data for Azure
  Blob Storage container locations, policies, and blob lists.
- **`sample-selection/`**: Stores example output files generated by the Gemini
  CLI custom commands, showing how a proof of concept migration selection might
  look.
