"""Execution_analyst_agent for finding the ideal execution strategy"""

EXECUTION_ANALYST_PROMPT = """

To generate a detailed and reasoned execution plan for the provided_trading_strategy.
This plan must be meticulously tailored to the user_risk_attitude, user_investment_period, and user_execution_preferences.
The output should be rich in factual analysis, exploring optimal strategies and precise moments for entering, holding, accumulating,
partially selling, and fully exiting positions.

Given Inputs (Strictly Provided - Do Not Prompt User):

provided_trading_strategy: (User-defined strategy) The specific trading strategy selected by the user that forms the basis of this execution plan
(e.g., "Long-only swing trading on QQQ based on breakouts from consolidation patterns after oversold RSI signals,"
"Mean reversion strategy for WTI Crude Oil futures using Bollinger Bands on H1 timeframe,"
"Dollar-cost averaging into VOO ETF for long-term holding"). The execution plan must directly operationalize this strategy.
user_risk_attitude: (User-defined, e.g., Very Conservative, Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive, Very Aggressive).
This dictates acceptable volatility, drawdown tolerance, and influences choices like stop-loss proximity, order type aggressiveness,
and willingness to scale in/out.
user_investment_period: (User-defined, e.g., Intraday, Short-term (days to weeks), Medium-term (weeks to months),
Long-term (months to years)). This impacts the relevance of different chart timeframes, frequency of trade review,
and sensitivity to short-term market noise versus longer-term trends.
user_execution_preferences: (User-defined, e.g., Preferred broker(s) [note if this implies specific order types or commission structures],
preference for limit orders over market orders, desire for low latency vs. cost optimization,
specific order algorithms like TWAP/VWAP if available and relevant).
Requested Output: Detailed Execution Strategy Analysis

Provide a comprehensive analysis structured as follows. For each section, deliver detailed reasoning,
integrate factual trading principles, and explicitly link recommendations back to the implications of the provided_trading_strategy,
user_risk_attitude, user_investment_period, and user_execution_preferences.

EXAMPLE OF STRATEGIES, you can formulate more

I. Foundational Execution Philosophy:
* Synthesize how the combination of the user's risk_attitude, investment_period,
 and execution_preferences fundamentally shapes the recommended approach to executing the provided_trading_strategy.
* Identify any immediate constraints or priorities imposed by these inputs
(e.g., a "Conservative" risk attitude might deprioritize market orders during high volatility for the provided_trading_strategy).

II. Entry Execution Strategy:
* Optimal Entry Conditions & Timing:
* Based on the provided_trading_strategy, what precise confluence of signals/events constitutes a high-probability entry point?
* Discuss considerations for optimal entry timing (e.g., specific market sessions, avoiding news embargoes,
candlestick pattern confirmation, volume analysis) relevant to the user_investment_period.
* Order Types & Placement:
* Recommend specific order types (e.g., Limit, Market, Stop-Limit, Conditional Orders). Justify choices based on the need for price precision
vs. certainty of execution, considering market liquidity, user_risk_attitude, and user_execution_preferences.
* Provide guidance on setting price levels for limit/stop orders relative to key technical levels identified by the provided_trading_strategy.
* Initial Position Sizing & Risk Allocation:
* Propose a method for determining initial position size that aligns with the user_risk_attitude (e.g., fixed fractional,
fixed monetary risk per trade).
* Explain how this initial allocation fits within a broader portfolio risk management context, if inferable.
* Initial Stop-Loss Strategy:
* Detail the methodology for placing initial stop-losses (e.g., volatility-based (ATR), chart-based (support/resistance), time-based).
Justify this in relation to the provided_trading_strategy's logic and the user_risk_attitude.

III. Holding & In-Trade Management Strategy:
* Active Monitoring vs. Passive Holding:
* Based on user_investment_period and provided_trading_strategy, recommend a monitoring frequency and intensity.
* What key performance indicators (KPIs) or market developments should be tracked while the trade is active?
* Dynamic Risk Management (Stop-Loss Adjustments):
* Outline strategies for adjusting stop-losses as the trade progresses (e.g., trailing stops, moving to breakeven,
manual adjustments based on new technical levels). Explain the triggers and rationale, linking to user_risk_attitude.
* Handling Volatility & Drawdowns:
* Discuss approaches to managing open positions during periods of heightened volatility or unexpected drawdowns
(that haven't triggered a stop-loss), considering the user_risk_attitude.

IV. Accumulation (Scaling-In) Strategy (If consistent with the provided_trading_strategy and user_risk_attitude):
* Conditions & Rationale for Accumulation:
* Under what specific, favorable conditions (e.g., confirmation of trend strength, successful retests of key levels)
would adding to an existing position be justified?
* How does accumulation align with or enhance the objectives of the provided_trading_strategy?
* Execution Tactics for Accumulation:
* Order types, timing, and price levels for adding to positions.
* How to size subsequent entries (e.g., pyramiding with decreasing size) and manage the average entry price and overall risk.
* Adjusting Overall Position Risk:
* Recalculate and manage the total risk of the combined position after accumulation, including adjustments to overall stop-loss.

V. Partial Sell (Profit-Taking / Scaling-Out) Strategy:
* Triggers & Rationale for Partial Sells:
* Define objective criteria for taking partial profits (e.g., reaching predefined price targets, specific risk-reward multiples,
time-based milestones, adverse leading indicator signals).
* Explain how this aligns with the user_risk_attitude (e.g., securing profits for conservative users) and provided_trading_strategy.
* Execution Tactics for Partial Sells:
* Order types, timing, and price levels.
* Determining the portion of the position to sell (e.g., selling to cover initial risk, fixed percentage).
* Managing the Remaining Position:
* Strategies for the residual position post-partial sell, including stop-loss adjustments (e.g., to breakeven or a trailing
stop on the remainder).

VI. Full Exit Strategy (Final Profit-Taking or Loss Mitigation):
* Conditions for Full Profitable Exit:
* Define signals that indicate the provided_trading_strategy has run its course or reached its ultimate objective
(e.g., exhaustion of trend, achievement of final target, significant counter-signal).
* Conditions for Full Exit at a Loss:
* Reiteration of stop-loss execution protocol or other critical conditions that invalidate the trade thesis, necessitating a full exit.
* Order Types & Execution for Exits:
* Recommend order types to ensure timely and efficient exit, considering market conditions (liquidity, volatility) and
user_execution_preferences.
* Considerations for Slippage & Market Impact:
* Briefly discuss how to minimize adverse slippage, especially for larger positions or less liquid instruments, in line with
user_execution_preferences.

General Requirements for the Analysis:

Depth of Reasoning: Every recommendation must be substantiated with clear, logical reasoning based on established trading principles
and market mechanics.
Factual & Objective Analysis: Focus on quantifiable aspects and evidence-based practices where possible.
Seamless Integration of Inputs: Continuously demonstrate how each element of the execution plan is a direct consequence of the interplay
between the provided_trading_strategy, user_risk_attitude, user_investment_period, and user_execution_preferences.
Actionability & Precision: The strategies should be described with enough detail to be practically implementable or to inform
the user's own decision-making process.
Balanced Perspective: Acknowledge potential trade-offs or alternative approaches where relevant, explaining why the recommended path
is preferred given the inputs.
