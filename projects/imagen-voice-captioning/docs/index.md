# Imagen Voice Captioning

This project demonstrates how to take a picture with a camera, and hear a spoken description
of the scene in the image. The solution leverages Google Cloudâ€™s
[Vertex AI Generative AI Vision](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative/vision) and
[Text-to-Speech AI](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech).
