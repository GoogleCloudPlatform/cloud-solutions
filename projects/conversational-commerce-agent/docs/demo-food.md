| Agent | Welcome to Cymbal Foods\! How can I help you? |
| Mika | I am hosting a dinner party this weekend for 6 friends. |
| Agent | Wonderful\! What kind of food are you thinking of making? |
| Mika | I have a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends coming over, so I need options for both. |
| Agent | Great\!  Do you have any allergies or dietary restrictions we should be aware of? |
| Mika | Yes, I am looking for grain-free options |
| Agent | Got it\! Do you plan on cooking the food yourself, or are you looking for pre-made dishes? |
| Mika | Definitely. I want to enjoy the whole party with my friends, not interested in cooking and cleaning all day. |
| Agent | No problem\!  I can help with that.  So you're looking for pre-made dishes, grain-free, for a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian guests, and for 6 people.  Is that correct? |
| Mika | Correct |

It's a delicious and refreshing option that's both grain-free and vegan.   For your non-vegetarian guests, I recommend the "Prosciutto & Chicken Sandwich". It's a hearty and satisfying meal that includes grilled chicken or steak, scrambled egg, roasted vegetables, tomato, brown rice, and avocado pesto. Would you like to order these? |
