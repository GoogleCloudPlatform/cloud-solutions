    "# 🤝 Agent2Agent (A2A) Communication with ADK\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook teaches you how to build **multi-agent systems** where different agents can communicate and collaborate using the **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**. You'll learn how to integrate with external agent services and consume remote agents as if they were local.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the A2A protocol and when to use it vs sub-agents\n",
    "- Learn common A2A architecture patterns (cross-framework, cross-language, cross-organization)\n",
    "- Expose an ADK agent via A2A using `to_a2a()`\n",
    "- Consume remote agents using `RemoteA2aAgent`\n",
    "- Build a product catalog integration system\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Overview of Agent2Agent (A2A)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As you build more complex AI systems, you'll find that:\n",
    "- **A single agent can't do everything** - Specialized agents for different domains work better\n",
    "- **You need agents to collaborate** - Customer support needs product data, order systems need inventory info\n",
    "- **Different teams build different agents** - You want to integrate agents from external vendors\n",
    "- **Agents may use different languages/frameworks** - You need a standard communication protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ The Solution: A2A Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/) is a **standard** that allows agents to:\n",
    "- ✨ **Communicate over networks** - Agents can be on different machines\n",
    "- ✨ **Use each other's capabilities** - One agent can call another agent like a tool\n",
    "- ✨ **Work across frameworks** - Language/framework agnostic\n",
    "- ✨ **Maintain formal contracts** - Agent cards describe capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Common A2A Architecture Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The A2A protocol is particularly useful in three scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "![When to choose A2A?](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day5/a2a_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Framework Integration**: ADK agent communicating with other agent frameworks\n",
    "2. **Cross-Language Communication**: Python agent calling Java or Node.js agent  \n",
    "3. **Cross-Organization Boundaries**: Your internal agent integrating with external vendor services\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 What This Notebook Demonstrates\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a practical e-commerce integration:\n",
    "1. **Product Catalog Agent** (exposed via A2A) - External vendor service that provides product information\n",
    "2. **Customer Support Agent** (consumer) - Your internal agent that helps customers by querying product data\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "┌──────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────┐\n",
    "│ Customer Support     │  ─A2A──▶  │ Product Catalog      │\n",
    "│ Agent (Consumer)     │           │ Agent (Vendor)       │\n",
    "│ Your Company         │           │ External Service     │\n",

    "└──────────────────────┘           └──────────────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this justifies A2A:**\n",
    "- Product Catalog is maintained by an external vendor (you can't modify their code)\n",
    "- Different organizations with separate systems\n",
    "- Formal contract needed between services\n",
    "- Product Catalog could be in a different language/framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 A2A vs Local Sub-Agents: Decision Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Use A2A | Use Local Sub-Agents |\n",
    "|--------|---------|---------------------|\n",
    "| **Agent Location** | External service, different codebase | Same codebase, internal |\n",
    "| **Ownership** | Different team/organization | Your team |\n",
    "| **Network** | Agents on different machines | Same process/machine |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Network latency acceptable | Need low latency |\n",
    "| **Language/Framework** | Cross-language/framework needed | Same language |\n",
    "| **Contract** | Formal API contract required | Internal interface |\n",
    "| **Example** | External vendor product catalog | Internal order processing steps |\n",

    "### 📝 Tutorial Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this tutorial**, we'll simulate both agents locally (both running on localhost) for learning purposes. In production:\n",
    "- Product Catalog Agent would run on vendor's infrastructure (e.g., `https://vendor.com`)\n",
    "- Customer Support Agent would run on your infrastructure\n",
    "- They'd communicate over the internet using A2A protocol\n",

    "\n",
    "**A2A Protocol Communication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, here's what happens at the protocol level:\n",
    "- **RemoteA2aAgent** sends HTTP POST requests to the `/tasks` endpoint on `http://localhost:8001`\n",
    "- Request and response data follow the [A2A Protocol Specification](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/)\n",
    "- Data is exchanged in standardized JSON format\n",
    "- The protocol ensures any A2A-compatible agent (regardless of language/framework) can communicate\n",
    "\n",
    "This standardization is what makes cross-organization, cross-language agent communication possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happened:**\n",
    "1. **Customer** asked about the iPhone 15 Pro\n",
    "2. **Customer Support Agent** (LlmAgent) received the question and decided it needs product information\n",
    "3. **Support Agent** delegated to the `product_catalog_agent` sub-agent\n",
    "4. **RemoteA2aAgent** (client-side proxy) translated this into an A2A protocol request\n",
    "5. The A2A request was sent over HTTP to `http://localhost:8001` (highlighted in yellow)\n",
    "6. **Product Catalog Agent** (server) received the request and called `get_product_info(\"iPhone 15 Pro\")`\n",
    "7. **Product Catalog Agent** returned the product information via A2A response\n",
    "8. **RemoteA2aAgent** received the response and passed it back to the Support Agent\n",
    "9. **Support Agent** formulated a final answer with the product details\n",
    "10. **Customer** received the complete, helpful response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transparency**: Support Agent doesn't \"know\" Product Catalog Agent is remote\n",
    "2. **Standard Protocol**: Uses A2A standard - any A2A-compatible agent works\n",
    "3. **Easy Integration**: Just one line: `sub_agents=[remote_product_catalog_agent]`\n",
    "4. **Separation of Concerns**: Product data lives in Catalog Agent (vendor), support logic in Support Agent (your company)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern enables:\n",
    "- **Microservices**: Each agent is an independent service\n",
    "- **Third-party Integration**: Consume agents from external vendors (e.g., product catalogs, payment processors)\n",
    "- **Cross-language**: Product Catalog Agent could be Java, Support Agent Python\n",
    "- **Specialized Teams**: Vendor maintains catalog, your team maintains support agent\n",
    "- **Cross-Organization**: Vendor hosts catalog on their infrastructure, you integrate via A2A"

    "\n",
    "Now that you understand A2A basics, try extending this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add More Agents**:\n",
    "   - Create an **Inventory Agent** that checks stock levels and restocking schedules\n",
    "   - Create a **Shipping Agent** that provides delivery estimates and tracking\n",
    "   - Have Customer Support Agent coordinate all three via A2A\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real Data Sources**:\n",
    "   - Replace mock product catalog with real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)\n",
    "   - Add real inventory tracking system integration\n",
    "   - Connect to real payment gateway APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced A2A Features**:\n",
    "   - Implement authentication between agents (API keys, OAuth)\n",
    "   - Add error handling and retries for network failures\n",
    "   - Use the alternative `adk api_server --a2a` approach\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deploy to Production**:\n",
    "   - Deploy Product Catalog Agent to Agent Engine\n",
    "   - Update agent card URL to point to production server (e.g., `https://vendor-catalog.example.com`)\n",
    "   - Consumer agents can now access it over the internet!\n",
