      "Major tech companies are developing AI agents by creating replicas of popular platforms like Amazon and Gmail for training purposes. This approach aims to improve AI's ability to navigate real-world digital interactions, with significant productivity gains reported by early adopters. However, risks include a high project cancellation rate, suggesting technical and commercial challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Health:**\n",
      "The FDA is deploying new agentic AI tools across its agency. Regeneron has partnered with Tessera Therapeutics for a $150 million gene editing collaboration. Additionally, health experts are criticizing recent FDA and CDC vaccine decisions, particularly concerning the retraction of the longstanding position that vaccines do not cause autism. The UK Health Security Agency is also issuing guidance on vaccinations and investigating cases of acute flaccid paralysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Finance:**\n",
      "The G7 Cyber Expert Group has released fundamental elements for collective cyber incident response in the financial sector. In Nepal, the stock market declined for the fourth consecutive day, though transaction volumes increased. The Nepal Rastra Bank issued a circular on new monetary policy review arrangements, including loan restructuring for flood-affected businesses. Costco is suing the US government for tariff payback, and Bitcoin's recent fall is impacting MicroStrategy.\n",
      "TechResearcher > With AI and Machine Learning continuing their rapid evolution, three key developments are shaping the near future: Generative AI, Agentic AI, and Multimodal AI. Generative AI is advancing beyond text to create complex multimedia content, including graphics, video, and music. Agentic AI systems are evolving into sophisticated virtual employees capable of completing entire tasks with minimal human input, automating workflows across various business functions. Multimodal AI enhances human-computer interaction by enabling systems to process and interpret diverse data types like images, audio, and text simultaneously, leading to more natural and efficient interactions.\n",

      "**Technology:** The tech landscape is currently buzzing with developments in artificial intelligence. OpenAI is reportedly working on a new LLM codenamed \"Garlic,\" with internal tests indicating strong coding and reasoning capabilities, while ChatGPT is described as being in \"code red mode\" amidst competition. Google and OpenAI have also imposed daily limits on their AI tools like Sora and Nano Banana due to high demand. Meanwhile, the tech industry is grappling with a global memory shortage, which is driving up prices for components like RAM and impacting the cost of consumer electronics such as smartphones. There are also ongoing advancements in hardware, with Samsung reportedly developing a foldable phone that opens to a 10-inch screen, and Sony updating its PS5 to address a liquid metal leak issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Health:** Recent breakthroughs in medicine include the development of an RSV vaccine, which has received FDA approval for adults aged 60 and older, offering protection against a virus responsible for significant hospitalizations and deaths. Another advancement is the drug teplizumab, which has shown the ability to delay the onset of Type 1 diabetes for years. In a significant stride for early detection, an AI-driven program developed at Johns Hopkins Medicine can now detect sepsis up to six hours earlier than traditional methods, leading to a 20% decrease in sepsis-related deaths in hospital trials. Looking ahead, medical technology is rapidly evolving, with AI projected to reach a market value of $614 billion by 2034. Innovations like microneedle vaccine patches, dual-insecticide bed nets, and drone delivery systems are poised to improve access to healthcare in low- and middle-income countries.\n",

      "User > Write a short story about a lighthouse keeper who discovers a mysterious, glowing map\n",
      "InitialWriterAgent > Elias polished the Fresnel lens until it gleamed, his only companion the ceaseless roar of the waves. For thirty years, the lighthouse had been his world. Tonight, however, a faint shimmer beneath a loose floorboard caught his eye. Prying it open, he found a rolled parchment, brittle with age. As he unfurled it, an ethereal blue light pulsed from intricate markings that shifted and reformed. It wasn't ink, but some phosphorescent substance. The lines traced no known coast, no familiar sea lanes. Instead, they depicted a labyrinth of submerged caverns and celestial alignments, culminating in a single, radiant star marked \"X.\" Elias, a man of routine, felt a tremor of an unknown adventure stir within him.\n",
      "CriticAgent > The story is promising, but could benefit from a bit more depth. Here are a few suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell Elias's Routine and Personality:** While it's stated Elias is a man of routine and the lighthouse has been his world for thirty years, we don't *see* much of this routine or feel the weight of his isolation. Consider adding a brief scene or detail that illustrates his monotonous life before the discovery, making the \"tremor of an unknown adventure\" feel more impactful by contrast. For example, describe the ritual of his polishing, the specific sounds he hears that are now familiar, or a brief thought about the unchanging nature of his existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Deepen the Mystery of the Map:** The description of the map is intriguing, but could be even more evocative. Instead of stating it's \"not ink, but some phosphorescent substance,\" describe *how* it glows. Does it flicker? Does it have a scent? Are the shifting markings subtle or dynamic? Similarly, the \"celestial alignments\" could be made more specific – are they constellations, planets, or something more abstract? This would enhance the sense of ancient, otherworldly knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Foreshadow the \"Unknown Adventure\":** The story ends with Elias feeling a \"tremor of an unknown adventure.\" To make this more compelling, you could hint at what this adventure might entail or the immediate consequence of his discovery. Does the light from the map cast strange shadows? Does the roar of the waves seem to change? A subtle hint of what lies beyond the lighthouse could propel the reader forward, making them eager to know what Elias will do next.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias meticulously polished the great Fresnel lens, the rhythmic sweep of his cloth a familiar ritual against the ceaseless roar of the waves. Thirty years he’d kept this solitary vigil, the lighthouse his unyielding world. Each night, the same: the lamp lit, the logbook filled, the lonely descent to his quarters. The salt-laced wind whistling through the tower’s stones was his only confidante, the crash of surf against the rocks his only music.\n",
      "\n",
      "But tonight, the monotony fractured. A faint shimmer, aberrant and out of place, caught his eye beneath a loose floorboard near his cot. His gnarled fingers, accustomed to the predictable weight of tools and lamp oil, pried at the aged wood. It groaned in protest, revealing a hollow space. Inside, a rolled parchment, brittle and yellowed, lay waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elias unfurled it, an ethereal blue light bloomed, pulsing with a soft, internal rhythm. It wasn't ink that formed the intricate markings, but some phosphorescent substance that seemed to writhe and reform as he watched, like captured starlight. The lines traced no known coast, no charted sea lanes. Instead, they depicted a labyrinth of submerged caverns, their passages winding like the intestines of some colossal sea beast. Strange celestial alignments, not of constellations he recognized but of alien planetary bodies, hung suspended above the treacherous geography. The map culminated in a single, radiant star, marked with a stark, definitive \"X.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The phosphorescence intensified, casting dancing blue shadows across Elias’s weathered face. The steady roar of the waves outside seemed to deepen, to take on a resonant, almost expectant tone. The parchment felt cool to the touch, yet it radiated a subtle energy that made the hairs on his arm stand on end. Elias, a man whose life had been defined by the unwavering beam of his lighthouse and the predictable turn of the tides, felt a tremor, profound and unfamiliar, stir within him. It was the tremor of an unknown adventure, whispering from the depths of the sea and the far reaches of the cosmos, promising a world far stranger than the one he had always known.\n",
