    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **complete animation pre-production workflow** using generative AI to create keyframes (critical frames in animated sequences) for a short film. You'll learn how to transform rough black-and-white sketches into polished, production-ready visual assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transform sketches into colored concept art** - Generate character designs and setting concepts from simple drawings\n",
    "2. **Create production-quality keyframes** - Use three progressive approaches (simple → advanced) to generate final shots\n",
    "3. **Explore cinematic variations** - Experiment with different camera angles, lighting, and compositions\n",
    "4. **Build a scene reference library** - Generate diverse character scenarios for storytelling and visual development\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who This Is For\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Animation Studios** exploring AI-assisted pre-production workflows\n",
    "- **Visual Development Artists** looking to accelerate concept exploration  \n",
    "- **Technical Directors** implementing AI pipelines for animation projects\n",
    "- **Researchers** studying generative AI applications in creative industries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Requirements:\n",
    "- ✅ **Google Cloud Project** with Vertex AI API enabled ([Setup Guide](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com))\n",
    "- ✅ **Python environment** with Jupyter notebook support\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Files:\n",
    "You'll need these black-and-white sketch files in `./images/storyboard_sketches/`:\n",
    "- `small_large_blob_sketch.png` - Character sketch (two blob characters)\n",
    "- `setting_sketch_1.png` - Setting sketch (carnival fair)\n",
    "- `key_frame_sketch_1.png` - Keyframe composition sketch\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don't have sketch files? The notebook will guide you through the process - you can use your own sketches or follow along with the provided examples.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a **4-section progressive workflow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Section 1: Character & Setting Development** \n",
    "Transform rough sketches into full-color concept art\n",
    "- **Input**: Black-and-white character and setting sketches\n",
    "- **Output**: Colored reference images for characters and settings\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Establish the visual \"North Star\" for your project\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Section 2: Keyframe Generation** \n",
    "Create production-quality keyframes using three approaches:\n",
    "- **2.a Zero-Shot** - Direct generation (fast, simple scenes)\n",
    "- **2.b Scene Description** - AI-enhanced prompts (complex scenes)\n",
    "- **2.c Critique & Refinement** - Creative director feedback loop (hero shots)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Learn when to use simple vs. sophisticated approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Section 3: Camera Angles & Lighting** \n",
    "Explore cinematic variations of your keyframes\n",
    "- **3.a Lighting Variations** - Apply different moods (chiaroscuro, golden hour, etc.)\n",
    "- **3.b Camera Angles** - Generate 12+ perspectives (close-ups, wide shots, bird's eye, etc.)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Create comprehensive shot lists for storyboarding\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Section 4: Scene Variations & Character Exploration**\n",
    "Generate diverse character scenarios for visual development\n",
    "- **Output**: Scene library with characters in varied settings, activities, and moods\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Build visual reference library and explore storytelling possibilities\n",
    "- **Bonus**: CSV catalog can be used for future model training (LoRA/Dreambooth)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these terms will help you navigate the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyframe**: A critical frame in an animation sequence that defines the main poses, composition, and emotional beats of a scene. Keyframes serve as anchor points that animators use to create motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setting**: The physical location or environment where a scene takes place (e.g., carnival fair, diner, park). Settings provide the backdrop and spatial context for character actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scene**: A complete narrative unit combining characters, actions, and a setting. A scene tells a small part of the story and may contain multiple keyframes showing different moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visual Development (VisualDev)**: The pre-production process of establishing a project's visual style, color palette, and aesthetic direction through concept art and reference materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",

    "    * **large blob:** Refer to the provided images for the large blob's appearance: A larger generic blob that is inflated with air.\n",
    "    * **small blob:** Refer to the provided image for the small blob's appearance: A smaller generic blob that is inflated with air.\n",
    "    * **Sizing:** Ensure the relative sizing between the large blob and the small blob in the generated images remains consistent with the visual cues in the provided reference images (i.e., the small blob should be a realistic size in relation to the large blob).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Focus on Activities, Interactions, and Scenes:** Generate prompts that place both the large blob and the small blob in different, yet generic, environments and engaged in generic, characteristic behaviors, often together.\n",
    "    * **Examples of scenes include:**\n",
    "        * Playing games at the Fair\n",
    "        * Winning a stuffed animal at a Fair game\n",
    "        * Walking to the diner for a late night meal\n",

    "    * **Examples of activities and interactions include:**\n",

    "        * small blob holding hands with the large blob\n",
    "        * large blob and small blob singing\n",
    "        * large blob feeding small blob\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Ensure Diversity:** The set of prompts must be highly varied. Mix up the scenes, activities, interactions, and camera angles (close-ups, medium shots, wide shots) to prevent repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Maintain Realism/Quality:** Each prompt should aim for a \"photorealistic,\" \"cinematic fantasy,\" or \"stylized render\" quality, suitable for generating high-resolution, detailed images.\n",

    "5.  **Output Format:** Provide the final output as a single list of text-to-image prompts. Each prompt should be a concise, descriptive phrase ready for an image generation model.\n",

    "## 1. Character and Setting Exploration from Sketch\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This section demonstrates the foundational step in the animation pre-production workflow: transforming rough black-and-white sketches into fully-realized, colored concept art. This is a critical stage where early creative ideas evolve from simple drawings into polished visual references.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Section Does\n",
    "We take two types of initial sketches:\n",
    "1. **Character Sketches**: Simple black-and-white drawings defining character shapes, proportions, and basic features\n",
    "2. **Setting Sketches**: Rough environment layouts showing composition and spatial relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Using generative AI, we transform these sketches into:\n",
    "- **Full-color character designs** with proper lighting, texture, and material properties\n",
    "- **Detailed setting concepts** with atmospheric lighting and rich visual detail\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "In traditional animation pipelines, this \"sketch-to-concept\" phase can take days or weeks as artists manually paint and refine ideas. By using AI to generate variations quickly, we can:\n",
    "- **Explore multiple design directions** in minutes rather than days\n",
    "- **Establish visual style** early in the production process  \n",
    "- **Create reference material** that guides all subsequent work (keyframes, final shots, etc.)\n",
    "- **Enable rapid iteration** on character and setting designs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Workflow\n",
    "1. Load black-and-white sketches (characters and settings)\n",
    "2. Use AI image generation to create colored, detailed variations\n",
    "3. Review and select the best outputs as our visual \"North Star\"\n",
    "4. Use these selected assets as references for all downstream experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as creating your **visual development library** - the core assets that define what your characters and world should look like in the final production."

    "## 2. Keyframe Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This section demonstrates three progressive approaches to generating production-quality keyframes for animation. A **keyframe** is a crucial frame in an animated sequence that defines the main poses, composition, and emotional beats of a scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore three methods of increasing sophistication:\n",
    "1. **Zero-shot generation** (simple, direct)\n",
    "2. **AI-assisted scene description** (enhanced detail)\n",
    "3. **Critique-based refinement** (highest quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use each approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero-Shot (2.a)**: Best for simple scenes with clear composition\n",
    "  - Works well when sketch, characters, and setting are straightforward\n",
    "  - Our carnival scene is relatively simple, so this approach yields good results\n",
    "  - Fast and efficient for basic keyframes\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Scene Description (2.b)**: Better for complex scenes needing rich detail\n",
    "  - Uses AI to analyze references and generate detailed text prompts\n",
    "  - Adds atmospheric details, lighting nuance, and emotional context\n",
    "  - Useful when you need more cinematic specificity\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Critique & Refinement (2.c)**: Best for critical hero shots and complex compositions\n",
    "  - Simulates a creative director review process\n",
    "  - Ensures fidelity to the original sketch while enhancing artistry\n",
    "  - Essential for complex scenes with multiple characters, intricate lighting, or specific emotional requirements\n",
    "  - Takes more time but produces highest quality results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Progressive Complexity Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "For **simple scenes** like our carnival keyframe:\n",
    "- Zero-shot often produces excellent results immediately\n",
    "- The additional steps may provide marginal improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "For **complex scenes** (multiple characters, dynamic action, intricate environments):\n",
    "- Zero-shot may miss important details or misinterpret composition\n",
    "- Scene description adds crucial context and specificity\n",
    "- Critique ensures accuracy and elevates artistic quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Workflow\n",
    "In this section, you'll:\n",
    "1. Load your keyframe sketch (the composition reference)\n",
    "2. Try all three approaches with the same inputs\n",
    "3. Compare the results to understand which approach works best for your needs\n",

    "## 4. Scene Variations and Character Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates how to explore your characters across diverse scenarios and settings. By generating multiple scene variations, you'll create a comprehensive visual reference library that showcases your characters' versatility and helps develop your story's visual language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scene variations explore:**\n",
    "- **Different settings** (carnival, diner, park, street, home, etc.) - varied physical locations\n",
    "- **Different activities** (playing, eating, reading, exploring, resting, etc.) - character behaviors\n",
    "- **Different moods** (playful, contemplative, dramatic, cozy, adventurous, etc.) - emotional tones\n",
    "- **Different interactions** (holding hands, playing together, sharing moments, etc.) - relationship dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Explore Scene Variations?\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating keyframes and exploring camera angles, generating diverse scene variations helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Develop your visual storytelling** - See how characters work in different contexts and discover new story moments\n",
    "2. **Build a comprehensive reference library** - Create a visual catalog for pitches, concept presentations, and production planning\n",
    "3. **Test character consistency** - Ensure your characters maintain their identity across varied scenarios\n",
    "4. **Discover narrative opportunities** - Unexpected scene combinations often inspire new story directions\n",
    "5. **Create marketing materials** - Generate diverse imagery for pitch decks, social media, and promotional content\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus:** The generated scene library can also be used as training data for fine-tuning custom AI models (LoRA, Dreambooth) if you decide to pursue that in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Two-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate Diverse Scene Prompts** - AI analyzes your character reference and creates varied scene descriptions exploring different settings, activities, and moods\n",
    "2. **Generate Scene Images** - Each prompt becomes a visual exploration, building your reference library\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook generates:\n",
    "- **Images**: Saved to `./images/generated/scenes/` - your visual reference library\n",
    "- **CSV catalog**: Organized record of all scenes\n",
    "  - Column 1: `prompt` - Description of each scene\n",
    "  - Column 2: `image_path` - Path to the image\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use Your Scene Library\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Storytelling & Production:**\n",
    "- Review scenes to discover narrative moments\n",
    "- Use as reference for consistent character design\n",
    "- Share with collaborators for creative feedback\n",
    "- Include in pitch decks and presentations"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated a comprehensive workflow for generating keyframes for an animated short film using generative AI. We progressed through a series of experiments, starting with foundational character and setting development, then iteratively refining keyframes through multiple approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterative Refinement is Essential**: The quality of the final keyframe is significantly improved through a process of iterative refinement, incorporating feedback and exploring different creative approaches (zero-shot → scene description → critique).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Power of System Instructions**: Well-crafted system instructions and prompts are crucial for guiding the generative models to produce the desired output with high fidelity to your creative vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Creative Collaboration with AI**: This notebook showcases a collaborative workflow where AI serves as a powerful tool for creative exploration and rapid asset generation, accelerating pre-production timelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Approach Selection Matters**: Simple scenes work well with zero-shot generation, while complex compositions benefit from scene description or critique-based refinement approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fine-tune a Custom Model (Optional)**: The scene library CSV catalog from Section 4 can be used to fine-tune a model (e.g., using LoRA or Dreambooth) to create a highly specialized model for generating these blob characters with consistent style and appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Storyboarding and Animatics**: The generated keyframes can be used as a foundation for creating a full storyboard and animatic for the short film, maintaining visual consistency throughout production.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exploring Different Artistic Styles**: The same workflow can be applied to explore different artistic styles for the short film by modifying the prompts, reference images, and system instructions to achieve varied visual aesthetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Production Pipeline Integration**: Integrate this workflow into existing animation pipelines to accelerate visual development, concept art generation, and pre-visualization phases."
