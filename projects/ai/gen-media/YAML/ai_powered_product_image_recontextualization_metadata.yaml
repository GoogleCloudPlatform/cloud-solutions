# The name of the demo.
title: "GenMedia: AI-Powered Product Image Re-contextualization"

# A short description of the demo.
thumbnail_summary: A pipeline that uses generative AI to transform standard product photos into realistic, contextualized lifestyle images for e-commerce.

# [Optional] A summary of the demo's intention. Markdown supported.
purpose: |
  This demo showcases an end-to-end workflow for automatically re-contextualizing product images. It takes clean, studio-shot product photos from Google Cloud Storage, uses a powerful generative AI model (Gemini) to place the product into a new, appropriate, and realistic environment, and then uses another AI model to evaluate the quality of the generated image across multiple dimensions like product fidelity, scene realism, and aesthetic quality.

  The goal is to automate the creation of high-quality lifestyle imagery for marketing and e-commerce at scale.

business_value: |
  Automates the costly and time-consuming process of lifestyle photoshoots, enabling e-commerce businesses to quickly generate a wide variety of engaging, high-quality marketing images.

  Key benefits include:
  * **Reduced Costs:** Eliminate the need for expensive photoshoots and studio setups
  * **Increased Speed:** Generate hundreds of variations in minutes instead of days
  * **Enhanced Engagement:** Create diverse, contextual imagery that resonates with different customer segments
  * **Higher Conversion Rates:** Lifestyle images have been proven to increase purchase intent
  * **Scalability:** Process entire product catalogs automatically

# [Optional] A summary of the demo's technical value. Markdown supported.
technical_value: |
  Demonstrates a scalable, multi-stage AI pipeline on Vertex AI:
  * **Parallel Processing:** Leverages concurrent execution for both image generation and evaluation tasks
  * **Multi-Model Architecture:** Uses different Gemini models optimized for specific tasks - an advanced model for image generation and a fast, cost-effective model for detailed evaluation
  * **Structured Output:** Implements JSON-based evaluation metrics for systematic quality assessment
  * **Cloud-Native Design:** Built on Google Cloud Storage and Vertex AI for enterprise-scale deployment
