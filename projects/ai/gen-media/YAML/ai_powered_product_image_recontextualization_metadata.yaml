title: AI-Powered Product Image Re-contextualization
thumbnail_summary:
  A pipeline that uses generative AI to transform standard product photos
  into realistic, contextualized lifestyle images for e-commerce.
purpose:
  This demo showcases an end-to-end workflow for automatically re-contextualizing
  product images. It takes clean, studio-shot product photos from Google Cloud
  Storage, uses a powerful generative AI model (Gemini) to place the product into
  a new, appropriate, and realistic environment, and then uses another AI model
  to evaluate the quality of the generated image across multiple dimensions like
  product fidelity, scene realism, and aesthetic quality. The goal is to automate
  the creation of high-quality lifestyle imagery for marketing and e-commerce at
  scale.
business_value:
  Automates the costly and time-consuming process of lifestyle photoshoots,
  enabling e-commerce businesses to quickly generate a wide variety of engaging,
  high-quality marketing images. This can lead to increased customer engagement,
  higher conversion rates, and a significant reduction in content creation costs.
technical_value:
  Demonstrates a scalable, multi-stage AI pipeline on Vertex AI. It
  leverages parallel processing for both image generation and evaluation tasks.
  The solution uses different Gemini models for specific tasks an advanced
  model for image generation and a fast, cost-effective model for detailed, structured
  evaluation of the output, showcasing a sophisticated, multi-modal AI application.
