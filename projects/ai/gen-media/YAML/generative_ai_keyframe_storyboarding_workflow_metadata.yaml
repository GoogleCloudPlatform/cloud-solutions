# The name of the demo.
title: "GenMedia: Generative AI Keyframe Storyboarding Workflow"

# A short description of the demo.
thumbnail_summary: Demonstrates a complete animation pre-production workflow using generative AI to transform rough sketches into polished, production-ready keyframes and visual assets.

# [Optional] A summary of the demo's intention. Markdown supported.
purpose: |
  This notebook showcases a 4-section progressive workflow for animation pre-production. It guides users through transforming black-and-white sketches into full-color concept art for characters and settings, generating production-quality keyframes using various techniques (Zero-Shot, AI-assisted Scene Description, and Critique-based Refinement), exploring cinematic variations with different camera angles and lighting, and building a comprehensive scene reference library for storytelling and visual development.

  Key learning objectives:
  * Transform sketches into production-ready concept art
  * Generate keyframes using multiple AI techniques
  * Explore cinematic variations systematically
  * Build comprehensive visual reference libraries

# [Optional] A summary of the demo's business value. Markdown supported.
business_value: |
  For animation studios and visual development artists, this workflow dramatically accelerates the pre-production pipeline.

  Key benefits include:
  * **Speed to Market:** Reduce pre-production time from weeks to hours
  * **Cost Reduction:** Minimize manual iteration and revision cycles
  * **Creative Freedom:** Explore multiple design directions quickly
  * **Early Visualization:** Establish visual style before expensive production begins
  * **Client Satisfaction:** Present multiple options for rapid approval
  * **Asset Reusability:** Build libraries for future projects

# [Optional] A summary of the demo's technical value. Markdown supported.
technical_value: |
  This demo highlights a sophisticated, multi-stage generative AI pipeline on Vertex AI using Gemini models:
  * **Progressive Complexity:** Employs incremental prompt engineering from simple zero-shot to multi-step critique loops
  * **Creative Director Simulation:** Implements AI feedback loops that mimic professional creative review
  * **Parallel Processing:** Demonstrates asynchronous image generation for creating 12+ variations simultaneously
  * **Multi-Modal Integration:** Combines text and image inputs for contextual generation
  * **Quality Control:** Built-in evaluation and refinement mechanisms
