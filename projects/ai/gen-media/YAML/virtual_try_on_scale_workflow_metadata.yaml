title: Virtual Try-On Scale Workflow
thumbnail_summary:
  A comprehensive, end-to-end pipeline for generating diverse, photorealistic
  Virtual Try-On (VTO) images and motion videos using Google's Generative AI
  models on Vertex AI.
purpose: This project demonstrates a scalable workflow for fashion e-commerce
  applications that generates diverse digital models with various demographics,
  performs high-fidelity virtual garment try-on, adds realistic motion to showcase
  garments in runway-style videos, and processes inputs at scale from CSV files
  using Google Cloud Storage.
business_value: This solution enables fashion e-commerce businesses to showcase
  their products on a diverse set of digital models, reducing the need for costly
  and time-consuming photoshoots. It allows for rapid and scalable creation of
  marketing assets, enhancing online customer experience and engagement.
technical_value:
  The demo showcases a multi-model AI pipeline on Vertex AI, utilizing
  Gemini for orchestration and critique, another Gemini model for image generation,
  Vertex AI Virtual Try-On for garment transfer, and Veo for video generation. The
  architecture is designed for scalability with parallel processing and batch inputs
  from Google Cloud Storage.
