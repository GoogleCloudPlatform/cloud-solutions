# Migrate from AWS to Google Cloud: Get started

Google Cloud provides tools, products, guidance, and professional services to
help you migrate workloads, data, and processes from Amazon Web Services (AWS)
to Google Cloud This document introduces a discussion about how to design,
implement, and validate a plan to migrate from AWS to Google Cloud

The discussion is intended for cloud administrators who want details about how
to plan and implement a migration process. It's also intended for
decision-makers who are evaluating the opportunity to migrate and who want to
explore what migration looks like.

Migrating your workloads, data, and processes from AWS to Google Cloud can be a
challenging task and can take days, weeks, or months to complete, depending on
the scope and size of the migration. Therefore, we recommend that you plan and
execute your migration carefully.

AWS and Google Cloud products that target similar use cases might seem similar
in the way you provision, configure, and use the resources that they provide.
However, despite similarities, these resources might differ significantly in the
way they work and in their requirements. We therefore recommend that you assess
the ways in which similar AWS and Google Cloud resources work before you plan
your migration.
