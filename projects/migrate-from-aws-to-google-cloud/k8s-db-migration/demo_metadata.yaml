title: Migrate Amazon EKS and Amazon RDS to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Cloud SQL
thumbnail_summary: Demonstrate the replatforming of a containerized banking application from Amazon EKS and Amazon RDS to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot and Cloud SQL, including Kubernetes cluster discovery and data replication.

purpose: |
  This guide walks through replatforming a containerized application from Amazon EKS and Amazon RDS to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot and Cloud SQL. The process involves a "lift-and-shift" migration for the application layer (redeploying stateless workloads) and a data replication migration for the database layer using Database Migration Service (DMS). It also highlights the use of the Kubernetes Cluster Discovery Tool for comprehensive inventory of Kubernetes objects.

  Key learning objectives:
  * Replatform a containerized application from Amazon EKS to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot.
  * Migrate an Amazon RDS database to Cloud SQL using Database Migration Service (DMS).
  * Perform a "lift-and-shift" migration for stateless application workloads.
  * Utilize the Kubernetes Cluster Discovery Tool to assess source environments and build inventory.
  * Generate migration recommendations using Gemini CLI for EKS cluster analysis.

business_value: |
  * **Modernization:** Move to a fully managed Kubernetes service (GKE Autopilot) and a managed database (Cloud SQL), reducing operational burden and improving reliability.
  * **Cost Efficiency:** GKE Autopilot automatically scales and optimizes resources, leading to potential cost savings compared to self-managing EKS clusters.
  * **Enhanced Developer Experience:** Focus on application development rather than infrastructure management, with seamless deployments to GKE.
  * **Data Integrity:** Ensure continuous data replication during migration using Database Migration Service, minimizing downtime and data loss.
  * **Informed Decision Making:** Leverage automated discovery and Gemini-powered recommendations for a data-driven migration strategy.

technical_value: |
  * **Hybrid Cloud Tools:** Demonstrates the use of Terraform for both AWS and GCP infrastructure provisioning, ensuring consistency and automation.
  * **Kubernetes Cluster Discovery:** Utilizes the Kubernetes Cluster Discovery Tool for detailed inventory and assessment of EKS resources, aiding in migration planning.
  * **Gemini-Powered Migration Analysis:** Showcases the integration of Gemini CLI to generate intelligent migration plans based on discovered EKS assets.
  * **Managed Kubernetes:** Migrates to GKE Autopilot, abstracting away Kubernetes cluster management and node provisioning.
  * **Database Replication:** Implements the Database Migration Service (DMS) for secure and efficient replication of PostgreSQL data from RDS to Cloud SQL.
  * **Containerized Deployment:** Details the process of building container images, pushing to Artifact Registry, and deploying to GKE.
