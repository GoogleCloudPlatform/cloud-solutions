One important thing to note, is that while the BigQuery table `orders` is partitioned (the partition column is `created_at`), but looking at the DDL for Hive, there is no hints for that.
This is because the table here is an __external__ one. Meaning, the BigQuery table was created separately, and the Hive table is just "mounting" the storage layer for that, much like external tables for Hive on top of HDFS/GCS data. This will __NOT__ be the case if you had created the table as an "internal" hive table, which would create the BigQuery table on that same operation.
In that case, you would need to tell BigQuery the partitioning schema, using some more `TBLPROPERTIES`. An example for a DDL to create a Hive table with BigQuery partitioned storage will be:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id BIGINT,
        user_id BIGINT,
        status STRING,
        gender STRING,
        created_at TIMESTAMP,
        returned_at TIMESTAMP,
        shipped_at TIMESTAMP,
        delivered_at TIMESTAMP,
        num_of_item BIGINT,
        created_date DATE
    ) STORED BY 'com.google.cloud.hive.bigquery.connector.BigQueryStorageHandler'
    TBLPROPERTIES (
        'bq.table'='{project}.{dataset}.orders',
        'bq.time.partition.field'='created_at',
        'bq.time.partition.type'='DAY',
    )
```
