Let's go over the tables:

- `users` - a standard BigQuery native table.
- `order_items` - an EXTERNAL table with data in `PARQUET` format on the `warehouse` GCS bucket.
- `inventory_items` - another standard BigQuery native table.
- `orders` - is a partitioned BigQuery native table, partitioned on the `created_at` column.
- `events` - is an EXTERNAL table, also in `PARQUET` format, on the same bucket, but the data is also partitioned, with the HIVE path format. You will take a closer look later.
