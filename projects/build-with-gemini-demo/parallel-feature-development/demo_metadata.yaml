title: Parallel Feature Development with Gemini CLI
thumbnail_summary: Demonstrate how to use Gemini CLI to simulate a multi-agent workflow.
purpose: |
  * Explain the existing codebase.
  * Set up Git worktrees for parallel development.
  * Implement UI and backend features in parallel using separate Gemini CLI sessions.
  * Commit changes to the respective feature branches.
  * Merge the feature branches into the main branch, resolving any conflicts.
  * Test the final integrated application.
business_value: |
  This workflow offers significant business advantages by enabling parallel development, which accelerates the delivery of new features and improvements.

  Key benefits include:
  * **Accelerated Time-to-Market:** By working on multiple features concurrently, development teams can deliver value to users faster.
  * **Increased Developer Productivity:** Developers can work on different features in isolation, reducing dependencies and context-switching overhead.
  * **Improved Code Quality:** The use of separate worktrees and branches for each feature helps to isolate changes and reduce the risk of introducing bugs.
  * **Enhanced Collaboration:** The process of merging parallel changes encourages communication and collaboration among team members.
  * **Greater Flexibility:** This approach allows for more flexibility in planning and prioritizing features, as development streams can be managed independently.
technical_value: |
  This demo showcases a powerful combination of Git worktrees and the Gemini CLI for advanced development workflows.

  Key technical insights:
  * **Git Worktrees:** Demonstrates the use of Git worktrees to manage multiple working directories and branches within a single repository.
  * **Multi-Agent Development:** Illustrates how multiple Gemini CLI sessions can be used as autonomous agents to work on different tasks in parallel.
  * **Conflict Resolution:** Shows how to merge changes from parallel development streams and resolve any conflicts that may arise.
  * **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Leverages the Gemini CLI to automatically generate code for both UI and backend features.
  * **End-to-End Workflow:** Provides a complete end-to-end workflow for parallel feature development, from codebase explanation to final testing.
