title: Prototype ADK Agents with Gemini CLI
thumbnail_summary:
  This repository serves as a prototype for building ADK (Agent Development
  Kit) agents using the Gemini CLI
purpose: |
  This repository serves as a prototype for building ADK (Agent Development Kit) agents using the Gemini CLI. It demonstrates how to leverage existing context files and custom commands to streamline the agent development process.

  Key learning objectives:
  * Understand the key files used in the prototype.
  * Learn about the custom commands available for planning and implementing ADK agents.
business_value: |
  This prototype offers a streamlined and efficient approach to ADK agent development, which can lead to significant business benefits.

  Key benefits include:
  * **Accelerated Development:** The use of custom commands and existing context files can significantly speed up the development of ADK agents.
  * **Improved Code Quality:** The use of predefined plans and best practices helps to ensure that the generated agents are of high quality.
  * **Reduced Development Costs:** By automating many of the tasks involved in agent development, this prototype can help to reduce development costs.
  * **Increased Developer Productivity:** The streamlined workflow and powerful tools can help to increase developer productivity and satisfaction.
technical_value: |
  * **Custom Commands:** The use of custom commands in the Gemini CLI allows for the automation of complex tasks and the enforcement of best practices.
  * **Context-Aware Development:** The use of existing context files, such as `GEMINI.md` and `AGENTS.txt`, allows the agent to generate code that is consistent with the existing codebase and follows established patterns.
  * **Plan-Based Implementation:** The use of a plan-based implementation approach helps to ensure that the generated agent meets the specified requirements and is of high quality.
