title: Build with Antigravity
thumbnail_summary: Demonstrate how Antigravity's agentic development platform accelerates
purpose: |
  This guide demonstrates how Antigravity's agentic development platform can accelerate your software development. It teaches how to leverage Antigravity's powerful, customizable workflows to automate and streamline various stages of the development process.

  Key learning objectives:
  * Prototype a new application using the `/idea-to-app` workflow.
  * Generate comprehensive unit tests automatically with the `/unit-tests` workflow.
  * Perform proactive security scans using the `/security-scan` workflow (e.g., with Snyk).
  * Automate documentation generation with the `/documentation` workflow.
  * Streamline GitHub Pull Request creation using the `/open-pr` workflow.
business_value: |
  Antigravity significantly enhances developer productivity and software quality across the development lifecycle.

  Key benefits include:
  * **Increased Developer Velocity:** Automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, allowing developers to focus on core innovation.
  * **Improved Code Quality:** Enforce coding standards and generate robust unit tests automatically.
  * **Enhanced Security Posture:** Proactively identify and address vulnerabilities through integrated security scanning.
  * **Streamlined Collaboration:** Automate PR creation and documentation, fostering more efficient team collaboration.
  * **Reduced Operational Costs:** Decrease manual effort in testing, security, and documentation, leading to overall cost savings.
technical_value: |
  * **Agentic Development Platform:** Showcases Antigravity as a platform leveraging intelligent agents for autonomous development tasks.
  * **Customizable Workflows:** Demonstrates the power of configurable workflows (`/idea-to-app`, `/unit-tests`, `/security-scan`, `/documentation`, `/open-pr`) defined in YAML.
  * **Guardrails via Rules:** Explains how Markdown-based rules enforce coding standards and behavioral expectations.
  * **Agent Skills:** Illustrates the use of reusable knowledge packages to extend agent capabilities.
  * **MCP Servers Integration:** Highlights secure interfacing with local tools, databases, and external services (e.g., GitHub, Snyk) via the Model Context Protocol.
  * **Automated SDLC Tasks:** Covers automation of prototyping, testing, security scanning, documentation, and source control operations.
