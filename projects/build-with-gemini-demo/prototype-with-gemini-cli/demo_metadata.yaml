title: "Prototype with Gemini CLI"
thumbnail_summary:
  Demonstrate how to go from an idea to a running web application
  in minutes using the Gemini CLI.
purpose: |
  This demo shows the power and efficiency of using the Gemini CLI for rapid prototyping. It guides you from a conceptual idea to a running web application prototype by leveraging the CLI's custom commands.

  Key learning objectives:
  * Prepare the environment for prototyping.
  * Build a specification for an application idea.
  * Implement the application using the specification.
  * Test the application and iterate on its features.
business_value: |
  The Gemini CLI significantly shortens the prototyping cycle, allowing for faster iteration and experimentation.

  Key benefits include:
  * **Faster Time to Market:** By automating boilerplate code generation and setup, developers can quickly validate ideas and focus on the core logic and unique aspects of their application.
  * **Reduced Development Costs:** The streamlined process and reduced manual effort can lead to significant cost savings in the long run.
  * **Improved Collaboration:** The use of a shared specification and automated code generation can improve collaboration between team members and stakeholders.
  * **Increased Innovation:** By making it easier and faster to prototype new ideas, the Gemini CLI can help to foster a culture of innovation within an organization.
technical_value: |
  * **Custom Commands:** The use of custom commands in the Gemini CLI allows for the automation of complex tasks, such as generating a specification from an idea or generating code from a specification.
  * **Iterative Development:** The Gemini CLI supports an iterative development process, allowing you to easily test and refine your application as you go.
  * **AI-Powered Code Generation:** The use of AI to generate code can significantly speed up the development process and help to ensure that the generated code is of high quality.
