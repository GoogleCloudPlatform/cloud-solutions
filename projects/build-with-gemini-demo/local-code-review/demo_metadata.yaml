title: Interactive code reviews with Gemini CLI
thumbnail_summary:
  Demonstrate how developers can get immediate, AI-driven feedback
  on local code changes.
purpose: |
  This guide provides a walkthrough for using the Gemini CLI Code Review extension to perform an interactive review of local code changes. This extension offers a powerful, low-friction method for developers to receive immediate, Gemini-driven feedback on their work-in-progress, without submitting a formal change request.

  Key learning objectives:
  * Install and verify the Gemini CLI Code Review extension.
  * Invoke the `/code-review` command in the terminal to review local changes.
  * Understand the output from Gemini's code review, including identified issues and suggestions for improvement.
  * Implement Gemini's suggestions to fix review findings and iterate on code quality.
  * Customize the code review process with project-specific coding guidelines and standards.
business_value: |
  Integrating interactive code reviews with Gemini CLI into the development workflow significantly enhances productivity and code quality.

  Key benefits include:
  * **Higher Code Quality:** Receive immediate, AI-driven feedback on local changes, leading to cleaner, more robust code before formal submission.
  * **Faster Iteration Cycles:** Accelerate development by quickly identifying and addressing issues early in the coding process.
  * **Reduced Pre-Submission Review Time:** Minimize the need for extensive manual reviews by catching common errors and improving code quality interactively.
  * **Streamlined Onboarding:** New team members can quickly learn and adhere to project-specific coding standards through automated guidance.
  * **Empowered Developers:** Provide developers with an intelligent assistant to self-correct and improve their code efficiently.
technical_value: |
  * **Gemini CLI Extension Integration:** Demonstrates the installation and usage of a Gemini CLI extension for specialized functionality.
  * **Interactive Code Analysis:** Utilizes the `/code-review` command to perform AI-powered analysis of uncommitted or committed local code changes against a base branch.
  * **AI-Driven Feedback:** Provides concrete suggestions and identifies potential issues such as race conditions, missing validation, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities.
  * **Iterative Refinement:** Supports an iterative workflow for fixing review findings based on Gemini's suggestions and re-running the review.
  * **Customizable Review Rules:** Highlights the extensibility of Gemini CLI to incorporate project-specific coding guidelines and standards.
  * **Git Integration:** Shows how the extension works with Git to compare changes between branches for review purposes.
